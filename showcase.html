					This is my first more or less real project outside of study work. This is quite simple chat bot for Skype. It's defining feature is that it's functionality can be extended with use of addons. In fact, without addons the bot bot is pretty much useless. The code is messy and the whole system is quite flawed. As of today the original project is broken. I'm working on a new version, but it might take a while.

					Some time ago Microsoft decided to remove P2P capability from Skype. That update broke some functionality on which _HC1WDN4Sbot relied. Microsoft also introduced official bot API for Skype. Because of this I decided to more or less rewrite the whole bot. So far not much is done and progress is going slowly due to many factors. Not much can be said about bot at this time. As of now, no repo is available.

					This site was made more or less because I wanted to know what webdev was like and because a personal website would've been pretty cool to have. So I decided to strap together this site. It's not much but I think it turned out pretty cool.
